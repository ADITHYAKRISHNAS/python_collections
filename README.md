# Python collection

Pythonâ€™s collections module provides a rich set of specialized container data types carefully designed to approach specific programming problems in a Pythonic and efficient way. The module also provides wrapper classes that make it safer to create custom classes that behave similar to the built-in types dict, list, and str.

Learning about the data types and classes in collections will allow you to grow your programming tool kit with a valuable set of reliable and efficient tools.

Back in Python 2.4, Raymond Hettinger contributed a new module called collections to the standard library. The goal was to provide various specialized collection data types to approach specific programming problems.

At that time, collections only included one data structure, deque, which was specially designed as a double-ended queue that supports efficient append and pop operations on either end of the sequence. From this point on, several modules in the standard library took advantage of deque to improve the performance of their classes and structures. Some outstanding examples are queue and threading.
